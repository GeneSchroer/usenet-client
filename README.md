# Overview
This is the CSE 310 final project assignment for the Fall 2016. It is a simple
implementation of the now defunct usenet, used in back in the days of computer
networks.

# Features
With the exception of usenet's known features,

* Graphical User Interface
* Platform Portability
* Extension of the usenet protocol

# DevOps Instructions
This project contains three important modules,

* net.310usenet.core
  All the core functionallity classes, are herein contained in order to assert
  the functionality of the project.

* net.310usenet.gui
  All the Graphical User Interface classes, which are inherited by other
  javax.swing classes e.g JFrame, JPanel, etc.

* net.310usetnet.utils
  All utilities classes, additional classes, that don't exactly fit into the
  core itself, but instead used by the core module.

### Roadmap

1. Implement the project at all cost disregarding optimization, documentation, testing, etc.
1. Revision for possible encapsulation, flexibility, and maintnance. Including code readability, renaming variables, methods, classes. It's likely that a new module maybe introduced if and when necessary.
1. Unit Testing of the modules for quality assurance purposes.
1. Documentation in adhering to javadoc conventions.
1. Actual implementation of the program itself.
